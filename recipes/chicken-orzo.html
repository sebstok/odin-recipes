    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>1 1/2 pounds boneless skinless chicken breasts</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons Cantanzaro herbs</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons unsalted butter</li>
      <li>1 shallot, minced</li>
      <li>6 cloves garlic, minced</li>
      <li>2 cups orzo pasta</li>
      <li>2 cups chicken broth</li>
      <li>1 3/4 cups milk</li>
      <li>1/4 cup whipping cream</li>
      <li>1/3 cup sun-dried tomatoes, cut into short, thin strips</li>
      <li>1 (5.2 ounce) package Boursin Garlic and Fine Herbs Cheese</li>
      <li>2 cups chopped spinach</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Season both sides of
        chicken breasts with Cantanzaro herbs and salt.
      </li>
      <li>
        Heat olive oil and butter in a deep dish cast iron skillet or Dutch oven
        over medium-high heat until shimmering. Add chicken in a single layer,
        and cook until browned, about 3 minutes per side. Remove to a plate and
        keep warm.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add shallot and garlic to the same skillet. Cook until fragrant, about
        30 seconds. Add orzo and stir to coat with oil.
      </li>
      <li>
        Stir in chicken broth, milk, and whipping cream; stir in sun dried
        tomatoes. Nestle Boursin cheese wheel into the orzo mixture in the
        center of the skillet. Add chicken back to the skillet; cover.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake in the preheated oven until orzo is tender with a bite and chicken
        is no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, about 40
        minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should
        read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).
      </li>
      <li>
        Move chicken to the side, and add in the spinach. Stir until spinach
        wilts, about 1 minute. Serve immediately.
